# Week 8 – React Dashboard for ML-NIDS

## Overview
In Week 8, a responsive React dashboard was developed to visualize real-time intrusion detection results generated by the ML-based NIDS engine.

The dashboard consumes backend APIs and displays alerts, statistics, and charts using Tailwind CSS and Recharts.

---

## System Integration
The system operates in three layers:

1. Python-based ML Detection Engine
2. Node.js Backend API with MongoDB
3. React Frontend Dashboard

Once the detection engine is started, alerts are generated automatically and visualized in real time on the dashboard.

---

## Dashboard Features

### 1. Live Alerts Table
Displays real-time intrusion alerts including:
- Timestamp
- Source IP
- Destination IP
- Probability score
- Final classification (Attack / Benign)

Data is fetched every 5 seconds using polling.

---

### 2. Statistics Cards
Top-level statistics include:
- Total alerts detected
- Percentage of benign traffic
- Percentage of attack traffic
- Live monitoring status

---

### 3. Charts

#### Donut Chart – Benign vs Attack
Shows the overall traffic distribution.  
The dominant percentage is displayed at the center for quick interpretation.

#### Line Chart – Recent Attack Probability
Visualizes changes in ML prediction probability over recent packets, helping identify spikes and suspicious activity.

---

## Monitoring Workflow
The detection engine is started manually during development. Once running, it continuously captures packets, performs ML inference, and sends alerts to the backend, which are reflected live on the dashboard.

---

## Outcome
A fully functional React + Tailwind dashboard was successfully implemented, providing real-time visibility into network intrusion detection results.

---

## Future Enhancements
- Backend-controlled start/stop monitoring
- Auto-start detection engine as a system service
- Additional analytical charts (protocol-wise, model-wise)
