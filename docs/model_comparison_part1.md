# Model Comparison â€” Part 1 (Day 20)

This table aggregates available metrics (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1, Train time). Missing entries mean the training script did not produce metrics or file is not present.

**Notes**:
- Accuracy can be misleading on imbalanced datasets; focus on Recall / Precision / F1 for attack detection.
- Train time measured as wall-clock seconds during training run (may vary by machine).
